# Text Diagrams

## What Is It?

A very simple plaintext file of different documents to help visualize how different technologies work. While learning the foundations of software development, I wanted to make some simple text diagrams for others to reference.

Current text-based diagrams include:
- JavaScript Run-Time Environment
- Node.js Run-Time Environment
- Node.js Components
- The V8 Engine
- The SpiderMonkey Engine
- Pass-By-Value vs Pass-By-Reference
- Concurrency and Parallelism
- Critical Render Path
- Cookie Based Authentication
- Modern Token-Based Authentication
- Generic Tree Data Structure
- Perfect Binary Tree Data Structure
- Full Binary Tree Data Structure
- Java Stack Memory Management

## How to View:
A monofont is needed for the best viewing experience.

Some diagrams needed more than 80 columns, such as the Node.js Runtime environment.
